# Road_Accident_Dashboard

This project is aimed at analyzing traffic accident data and identifying trends and insights related to casualties. The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the severity and impact of traffic accidents, including the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors.
⚠️🚑
A major issue that has an impact on communities all across the world is road safety. In this project I have created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, a powerful tool designed to analyse and visualize road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. This Excel-based dashboard empowers stakeholders with valuable insights to make data-driven decisions and pave the way towards safer roads.

## Skills showcased in this Project

- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis,
- Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function,
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart,
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation.

## KPIs:
- Primary KPI:
Total Casualties taken after the accident

- Primary KPIs:
Total Casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle

- Secondary KPIs:
Total casualties with respect to vehicle types
Monthly trend showing comparision of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
Maximum casualties by road type
Distribution of total casualties by road surface
Relation between casualties by area/location and by day/night

## Data Sourcing

The dataset can be found [raw data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/view) .

## Key Insights

📈 Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard reveals that a staggering 417,883 casualties occurred after accidents during the two-year period

📅 Peak Months: Overall the number of casulaties were slightly higher in 2021 than 2022. Maximum Casualties happened in the month of October and November in both the Years and minimum casualties take place in  the month of January and February.

🚗 Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to 79.8% of the total. On the other hand, casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.

🩸 Casualties by accident severity Slight severity form the bulk of casualties 84.1% whereas there are only 1.7% Fatal severity casualties.

🛣️ Road Type Analysis: Maximum Casualties by Single Carriageway road type (310.1K) and Minimum by Slip road(5.1K)

🌧️ Casualties Distribution by Road Surface: Highest Distribution of total casualties on Dry road surfaces (67%)

🏙️ Casualties Relation by Area/Location Urban areas form the majority of casualties after an accident (61%)

☀️ Casualties Distribution by light condtion: 73% of casulties take place in daylight condtion.

## Data Analysis

Created a "Data Analysis" sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to ease their work and gathered information. On this sheet nine pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between number of casualties and many factors such as- casualty type, vehicle type, road type, location etc. Monthly trends were also analysed for the years 2021 and 2022.

Below is a snippet of the Data Analysis Sheet

## Data Visualisation 

Data visualisation was done using pivot charts,

## Recommendations based on the Analysis

1.	By comparing casualty trends between the current and previous years on a monthly basis, the dashboard identifies critical periods of October and November. The road safety measure by the traffic police and other stakeholders must be active and focused during these high-risk periods. 
2.	Car drivers form bulk of the casualties so they must be targeted for awareness camps and strict monitoring, periodic check-ups on safe driving.
3.	Extra safety measures should be placed Single Carriageway roads and they must be upgraded to double lane wherever possible.
4.	Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions helps pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential. 
5.	Urban areas should be targeted for interventions to improve road safety in specific and during daytime.
